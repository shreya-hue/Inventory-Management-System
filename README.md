# Inventory-Management-System
The inventory management system, developed using Spring Boot, comprises two core components: the vendor service and the material service. The vendor service handles vendor management tasks, including profile creation, contract management, and order tracking. Conversely, the material service is responsible for managing inventory items, such as adding, categorizing, and tracking material usage. Both services offer RESTful APIs for seamless integration with other systems and employ robust security measures for data protection. With features like authentication, database integration, and scalability, this system provides organizations with a reliable and efficient solution for inventory management needs.
